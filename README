As the project name implies, this is a library in Qt which allows the developers to access the Google Data (huge) API.

The need for this library arose because of personal needs. So the roadmap is to implement basic functionality and then add support for Google Documents.

Got it? For starters only a subset of Google Data's API will be implemented.

The final goal is a KDE4 Plasmoid :D.
